## Professional Bio

My name is Bradley Ross and I am a junior at NMSU pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My key interests within computer science include the fields of data science, machine learning, and applied mathematics. Competence in Java, Python, C, and C++ provide me with a well-rounded skillset as a undergrad computer scientist. Knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and numerical methods aid in my ability to analyze data. While in a management position for a voice and data solutions company I gained skills and experience with command line server maintenance. Self-sufficiency, ambition, and a problem-solving mindset have supported my accomplishments and will continue to assist in my continued growth as a computer science professional.

## Personal Bio

Outside of my education and working on personal growth projects, I enjoy spending most of my free time with my wife and our two daughters. We enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, skateboarding, and floating the river. I find passion in both learning new skills as well as teaching and helping others. I appreciate art, comedy, music and video games when I have personal time. I also do my best to stay in shape through exercise, healthy eating, and mental exercise.
